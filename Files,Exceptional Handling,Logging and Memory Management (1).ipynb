    "**Q.8  What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The with statement is used for context management and provides a clean, safe way to handle files. Its main purposes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automatic Resource Management: It automatically opens and closes files, ensuring proper cleanup even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exception Safety: If an exception is raised while the file is open, the with statement guarantees the file will still be closed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cleaner Code: It eliminates the need to manually call file.close() and reduces boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Memory Efficiency: It prevents memory leaks by ensuring files are properly closed and resources are freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " **Why with is a Best Practice:**\n",
    "- Prevents file handle leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Makes code more Pythonic and readable\n",

    "- Reduces chance of errors (like forgetting to close a file)\n",

    "- Ensures better performance and stability\n",

    " - Customizable Output: You can configure logging to display messages at different levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and direct output to various destinations, such as the console, files, or external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Performance Monitoring: Logs help in tracking the performance of the application, including timings for specific operations, which can help in identifying bottlenecks.\n",

    " - Non-intrusive: Unlike print statements, logging does not interfere with the program’s output and can be turned on or off as needed, providing flexibility.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "To detect and handle runtime errors gracefully without crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **try** Block:\n",
    "  - Block where we write code that might raise an exception.Python attempts to run this code.\n",
    "  - If no error → the except block is skipped & executes normally.\n",
    "  - If error occurs → control shifts to except.\n",
    "  - If an exception is raised within the try block, Python immediately stops executing the remaining code inside the try block and jumps to the except block to handle the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **except** Block:\n",
    "  - Executes only if an exception is raised in the try block.\n",
    "  - Handles the error if an exception is raised in the try block.\n",
    "  - The except block allows you to specify what should happen if a particular exception occurs.\n",
    "  -  You can specify the type of exception you want to catch (e.g., except ZeroDivisionError:).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Can handle :**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Catch Specific exceptions/ errors (e.g., ValueError, ZeroDivisionError).  \n",
    "    - Define multiple except blocks as well as Multiple exception types\n",
    "    - You can handle types of exceptions with different except blocks\n",
    "    or\n",
    "    - use a generic one for all exceptions (except Exception:) for unknown errors\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    " **Purpose**:\n",
    "To automatically manage memory by reclaiming unused objects and preventing memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Key Mechanisms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reference Counting:**\n",
    "   * Every object has a reference count (number of references pointing to it).\n",
    "   * When the count becomes zero, the object is immediately deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Garbage Collector (GC):**\n",
    "   * Handles objects involved in **circular references** (e.g., two objects referencing each other).\n",
    "   * Periodically scans and frees memory that can't be reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generational GC:**\n",
    "   * Python divides objects into **3 generations** (0, 1, 2) based on age.\n",
    "   * Young objects are collected more frequently; older ones less often (for efficiency).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Pools (pymalloc):**\n",
    "   * Manages small memory blocks internally to reduce fragmentation and improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Manual Garbage Collection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import gc\n",
    "gc.collect()  # Manually trigger garbage collection\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Why It Matters:**\n",

    "* Optimizes memory usage.\n",
    "* Frees up space from unused objects.\n",
    "* Reduces risk of memory leaks in long-running programs."
